             <h3>   OK, so I’m just going to brief you on what we know right now about the situation as it’s all moving quite quickly, to be honest.
<br>
We know that IT have picked up suspicious activity on the network as part of a routine audit. They’re saying it looks like data has been changed in the primary customer database without authorisation and some of it seems to have been exported. Several thousand customer records seem to be affected but they’re still trying to establish exactly how many or how long this has been going on. It could be a couple of weeks before that’s done, apparently.
The contact centre are reporting customers calling in about suspect transactions on their accounts, and have been giving them general advice about resetting passwords and so on.
Legal are working with us on a statement but are clear we need to be careful about accepting liability here - it’s not clear if we’re a victim of a crime or if this is a bug in our systems.
<br>
<br>
So, for this interview we need you to come across as concerned but in control, OK? The key message here is that we’re taking this seriously and we’re investigating urgently, and we’ll keep customers informed. Don’t let them draw you into speculation. Is that OK?
<br>
<br>
Great, good luck, see you on the other side.
